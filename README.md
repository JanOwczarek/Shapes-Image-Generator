# Shapes-Image-Generator
A shape image generator sourced and extended from Advanced Python Programming: Build 10 OOP Applications (Udemy).

The application currently includes 3 classes that deal with defining and creating a canvas, square or rectangle and 3 classes that deal with defining the parameters for each.
The 3 classes that define parameters were part of my extension. Additionally, I added a class variable for canvas that tracks how many invocations were made and while loop with 
user input. Together, these two features allow the user to continue creating images and saving them to a preferred directory.
